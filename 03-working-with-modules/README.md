This section will explore the fundamentals of Angular module and examine decorators associated with it. See the creation of an Angular component without CLI, bootstrap components using Angular module,
and create feature and shared modules. We will work with third-party modules like BrowserModule and export/import arrays.

- Describe different elements of Angular module and the decorators associated with it
- Create an Angular component without the CLI, add a new compoenent to the module, and describe the decorator associate with the new module
- Bootstrap components with the desired component by making it the main component for bootstrapping the application
- Outline the inclusion and use of third party modules like BrowserModule and explain its functionalities
- Create a feature module, add components to it, and use it in the main module
- Create a multi-modular system and share the module with multiple modules
