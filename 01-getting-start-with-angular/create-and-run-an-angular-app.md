# Creating and Running an Angular Application

  ```BASH
  # Inside the desired working directory
  ng new Skills # builds the new application named Skills after few prompts
  cd Skills # change directory to the newly created application
  code . # assuming VScode is installed; opens the folder and its contents on Vscode
  ng serve # runs the boilerplate application. # by default: http://localhost:4200/
  ```
