# Defining Decorators in TypeScript

Decorator is just a function that can be used to work or modify other variables, functions, or even the entired class. Introduced with ES6. It's a piece of code that wraps another piece of code. They use the special syntax `@`. Multiple decorators can be applied to a declaration using **Decorator Composition** (chaining).

Decorators functions act as a wrapper over an existing piece of code. They can be asses to function parameters and accessors.
