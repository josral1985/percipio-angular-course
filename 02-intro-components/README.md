# Introduction to Components

This section elevates a basic working knowledge of Angular by discussing some more advanced practices. I am to learn how to create classes in TypeScript and add properties and functions to TypeScript classes.
I will be defining decorators in JavaScript and creating a simple Angular component. Add templates, styles, and styleUrls to Angular components. Furthermore, investigate binding data with interpolation and ng-bind.

## Objectives

- Define object-oriented programming concepts and outline how to create classes in TypeScript and covert TypeScript classes to functions
- Describle how to add private and public properties to a TypeScript class and explain the use of public properties outside the class
- Describe how to add functions to a TypeScript class and explain how to access public property in a class function
- Describe the concept of decorators in TypeScript and ow to add decorators to functions, class variables, and classes
- Create a component using the Angular CLI, add the component to a module, and add inline HTML to the component
- Add a multi-line template to an Angular component and an external template to a React component
- Add inline styles to an Angular component template and use style tags to add inline styles
- Add external style and multiple style files to Angular components
- Describe what's mean by bining state variables with interpolation, calling functions and mathematical expressions inside interpolation, the use of "ng-bind" for interpolating data, and the use of ng-bind with different HTML elements
